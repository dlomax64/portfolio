|I am from a small town in Middle Tennessee called Hohenwald. Upon graduating     |
|highschool, I attended Bethel University to pursue a Bachelors of Music in       |
|Trumpet Performance. During my freshman term at Bethel, I was awarded the        |
|Freshman Music Award for Most Outstanding Freshman in the Music Department.      |
|Looking for more challege and opportunities, I transferred to The University of  |
|Tennessee for my third year of college. However, due to personal reasons, I was  |
|unable to continue pursuing music. Luckily, I found a new passion in programming,|
|specifically web development, and switched my major to Computer Science! In the  |
|spring of my sophomore year, I joined a research team studying the software      |
|supply chain. For this project, I primarily worked on developing our website     |
|(https://worldofcode.org) to be a web interface to our database, making it much  |
|easier to access it for research. I am now working on data collection for our    |
|database, which is comprised of information about every open-source project      |
|available on repo forges on the internet.                                        |

|I hate to throw the old cliche of "My hobby is to collect hobbies", but for me   |
|it's fairly true. Being a professional musician for a time, I picked up Trumpet, |
|Piano, Ocarina, and Guitar.When I transferred to The University of Tennessee, I  |
|was exposed to working on cars by my roommate, which is now a hobby of mine.     |
|Being a avid reader since middleschool, reading is also a hobby. Due to          |
|frustration of being isolated because of Covid-19 I picked up running and biking |
|as a hobby. Lately I've been into modding retro technology. I modded an old iPod |
|with 128GB flash memory, a larger battery, a transparent faceplate, and gold     |
|backplate for example. And finally, the most self-evident hobby of programming.  |
