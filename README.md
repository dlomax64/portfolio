# This is the repo for my personal website at www.dlomax.net.
I built this site using React. The design was inspired by https://plaza.one. The windows ui elements are from https://github.com/react95/react95.

### TODO
* Implement ability to change the background and toggle CRT effect
* Optimize for mobile devices
* Make animations run more smoothly on lower-end computers
* Add fun easter-eggs like pb-minsweeper and winamp
